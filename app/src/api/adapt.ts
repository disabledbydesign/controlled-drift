 * items and no `date`. The alternative to adapting here was leaving Today on the fixture, and

 * June's, which is exactly the class of thing this surface exists to stop. So the mapping is

 *
 * ⚠ TWO FIELDS ARE STILL OPEN QUESTIONS and are NOT invented into a shape here:
 *   · `still_here` — contract §6 Q5, needs June's read. Carried through untouched, unrendered.
 *   · `appointments[]` — contract §6 Q9. **Prepended as ordinary rows**, because dropping them
 *     is the documented check-off-doesn't-stick bug (`plan_store.py:125-133` walks them
 *     specifically); a fixed-time anchor that renders nowhere cannot be checked off at all.
 *     Whether they should instead be a distinct band is Q9 and stays open.
 *
 * ⚠ A PRIORITY-shape plan has flat `items` and no blocks. The Priority view flattens blocks
 * anyway, so the flat list is carried in ONE unlabelled block. That is a container, not a
 * label the user reads — an empty `label`/`time`/`framing` renders no band header.

 *     sends an array. The v4 fixture typed it that way and the form editor binds it to a text
 *     input; joined here rather than changing the type under the editor.

 *     exactly this; see the type's own note.
 *
 * `output` falls back to `'Auto'`, matching `formFromPeriod` and the server's own default, so
 * the select never renders blank. No other field invents a value: a missing string is `''` and a
 * missing list is `[]` — never `undefined`, so no consumer has to guard.
 *
