/**
 * The PER-ROW plan write path — "not today", duration, and move.
 *
 * ── why this file exists ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Three endpoints were live and unreachable. The old overlay carried all three per row
 * (`docs/overlay_daily.html`, `editPanelHtml` ~2135); the v4 rebuild's row has only an edit chip,
 * which opens the object editor instead. Every one of these backends predates the rebuild — the
 * new surface simply never called them. This is the wire-in, not a new feature.
 *
 * ── WHAT THESE ROUTES ANSWER WITH, AND WHY IT IS THE POINT ───────────────────
 * All three return the REWRITTEN PLAN. That plan is the only proof the write landed, and taking
 * it is what makes the change survive a reload — the same reasoning `chunkBlock` records in
 * `shell/useAppState.ts` for the block check. A seam that answered `boolean` would force the
 * caller to re-fetch, or to leave an unchanged screen standing as if it were the new truth.
 *
 * ── TWO OUTCOMES, NOT THREE — AND WHY THE WARNING RIDES ON `saved` ───────────
 * Every one of these is `saved | failed`. There is deliberately no third variant, because unlike the
 * focus family (`api/focus.ts`) these routes have no refusal-on-200 convention: a 4xx is a real
 * not-written, and `client.ts` has already turned it into `{ok:false,error}` carrying the
 * server's own sentence.
 *
 * `not-today` DOES have a partial failure: the row comes off today's list, and then one of the
 * two logs (the 8h deferral window, the corrections record) may fail to write. The server sends
 * `{ok:true, plan, warning}` — the removal is NOT undone. So the warning is DETAIL ON THE SAVE,
 * exactly as `api/focus.ts` argues for its reactivation failures: the question this union answers
 * is "did it come off today's list?", and the answer is plainly yes. A separate `kind` would let
 * a caller that forgot the variant tell her a removal that happened did not — a lie about her
 * data, traded for a message she should merely have seen. `warning` is therefore always present
 * (`null` when clean), never optional, so it cannot be read as clean by forgetting a key.
 *
 * ── `not-today` IS CACHE-ONLY BY DESIGN. DO NOT MAKE IT DURABLE. ─────────────
 * No Anytype write, no status change, no reschedule. The 8h session window makes a SAME-DAY
 * regenerate honour it, and then it expires. June asked for exactly that: it holds for the day
 * and does not leak into future days. Its deferral record goes to `corrections_log`, not
 * `signal_log` — `signal_log` is her own typed words, and a machine-recorded deferral is not her
 * voice (June's correction, 2026-07-18; commit 1522ad5).
